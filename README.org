* Bring command-line utilities to your Emacs workflow

Use =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files= to define new functions that apply command-line utilities to current buffer or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] files.

For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun my/dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif ()
    "Convert all marked videos to optimized gif(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to gif"
     "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<f>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>.gif'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))
#+end_src

Can be applied as:

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/togif.webp" width="60%" />

This makes wrapping one-liners a breeze, so let's do some more...

** One-liners

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no

    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to jpg"
     "convert -verbose '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'"
     :utils "convert"))

  (defun my/dwim-shell-command-convert-audio-to-mp3 ()
    "Convert all marked audio to mp3(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to mp3"
     "ffmpeg -stats -n -i '<<f>>' -acodec libmp3lame '<<fne>>.mp3'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-http-serve-dir ()
    "HTTP serve current directory."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "HTTP serve current dir"
     "python3 -m http.server"
     :utils "python3"
     :focus-now t
     :no-progress t))
#+end_src

** Multi-line scripts

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no

          if [ -z \"$lat\" ]; then
            echo \"no latitude\"
            exit 1
          fi
          lon=\"$(exiftool -csv -n -gpslatitude -gpslongitude '<<f>>' | tail -n 1 | cut -s -d',' -f3-3)\"
          if [ -z \"$lon\" ]; then
            echo \"no longitude\"
            exit 1
          fi
          if [[ $OSTYPE == darwin* ]]; then
            open \"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=${lat}&mlon=${lon}&layers=C\"
          else

* Build a rich toolbox (or use mine)

While you may want to build your own command toolbox over time, I've also [[#my-toolbox][shared my toolbox]] (close to 100 commands).

If you create new command not found in my list, I'd love to hear about it. File an [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/issues/new][issue]] or just ping me ([[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium][Mastodon]] / [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][Twitter]] / [[https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium][Reddit]] / [[mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com][Email]]).

* A =shell-command=, =async-shell-command=, and =dired-do-shell-command= alternative

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/template.png" width="50%" />

** Run M-x =dwim-shell-command= to execute disposable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][DWIM]] shell commands
- Asynchronously.
- Using noweb templates.
- Automatically injecting files (from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] or other buffers) or kill ring.
- Managing buffer focus with heuristics.
- Showing progress bar.
- Quick buffer exit.
- More reusable history.

* Which files

=dwim-shell-command= determines which file(s) you want the command to operate on.

If visiting a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] buffer, draw the marked file(s).

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/diredmark.gif" width="75%" />

If visiting a buffer with an associated file, use that.

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/blur.png" width="75%" />

* noweb templates

Operate on drawn files using either the following:

  - =<<f>>= (file path)
  - =<<fne>>= (file path without extension)
  - =<<e>>= (extension)
  - =<<td>>= (generate a temporary directory)
  - =<<*>>= (all files joined)
  - =<<cb>>= (clipboard)

For example:

With drawn files =path/to/image1.png= and =path/to/image2.png=

  =convert <<f>> <<fne>>.jpg= expands to

  #+begin_src sh
    convert path/to/image1.png path/to/image1.jpg
    convert path/to/image2.png path/to/image2.jpg
  #+end_src

  while =ls -lh <<*>>= expands to

  #+begin_src sh
    ls -lh path/to/image1.png path/to/image2.png
  #+end_src

* Focus

=dwim-shell-command= creates a process buffer to capture command output, but neither displays nor focuses on it by default. Instead, it tries to guess what's more convenient to focus on.

While the process is busy, show a spinner in the minibuffer. No focus changes.

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/progress.webp" width="50%" />

After process is finished:

If there were any files created in the =default-directory=, jump to a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] buffer and move point to the new file (via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-Enter.html][dired-jump]]).

[[file:images/showme.png]]


If no new files were created, automatically switch focus to the process buffer and display its output.

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/apple.webp" width="50%" />

Note: You can prevent this automatic focus by prepending your command with whitespace.

  " convert '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'"

If the shell command caused any errors, offer to focus the process buffer and display its output.

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/couldnt.png" width="75%" />

*** Easily create utilities

Command-line utilities like [[https://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] can be easily integrated into Emacs flows (without the need to remember any flags or parameters) by wrapping command invocations into functions and invoking via =M-x= (or your favorite binding). Same DWIM behavior from =dwim-shell-command= is inherited.

* Quick exit

Process buffers are read-only and can be quickly closed by pressing =q=.
* More reusable history
Because of templates, command history becomes automatically reusable in other contexts.

#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/main/images/history.png" width="75%" />

* Install

=dwim-shell-command= is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][MELPA]].

[[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][file:https://melpa.org/packages/dwim-shell-command.svg]]

1. Install via M-x /package-install/.
2. Require, set edit style, and add company backend:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'dwim-shell-command)
#+end_src

Now you're ready to run

M-x =dwim-shell-command=

** use-package

Alternatively, can also install via [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], define your own commands and remap to =shell-command='s existing binding using something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package dwim-shell-command
    :ensure t
    :bind (([remap shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
           :map dired-mode-map
           ([remap dired-do-async-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
           ([remap dired-do-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
           ([remap dired-smart-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command))
    :config
    (defun my/dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif ()
      "Convert all marked videos to optimized gif(s)."
      (interactive)
      (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       "Convert to gif"
       "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<f>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>.gif'"
       :utils "ffmpeg")))
#+end_src
* My toolbox

I'm including an optional package ([[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]]), with all the command line utilities I've brought in over time. You can load this optional package via:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'dwim-shell-commands)
#+end_src

Note: =dwim-shell-command(s).el= gives you all commands, while =dwim-shell-command.el= provides only the building blocks.

Here are all the commands I've added so far...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Command" "Description") :exports results
